# BDSA2021Project

Project bank. Providing awareness of project ideas on the one side and supervision needs on the other is a challenge that affects teachers and students
every semester. The lack of a software technology able to provide a usefull yet
intuitive and seamless platform to connect supervisors and interested students
around a topic of interest cannot be suistained any longer.
The goal of this project is to create a matching service to connect student(s)
with potential supervisors for projects and theses. The site will allow supervisors
to post details of project ideas available and students to apply. This project
will create a database-driven mobile-friendly service to encourage supervisors
and students to engage in semester-long collaborations.
