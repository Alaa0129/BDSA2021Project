# BDSA2021Project

Project bank. Providing awareness of project ideas on the one side and supervision needs on the other is a challenge that affects teachers and students
every semester. The lack of a software technology able to provide a usefull yet
intuitive and seamless platform to connect supervisors and interested students
around a topic of interest cannot be suistained any longer.
The goal of this project is to create a matching service to connect student(s)
with potential supervisors for projects and theses. The site will allow supervisors
to post details of project ideas available and students to apply. This project
will create a database-driven mobile-friendly service to encourage supervisors
and students to engage in semester-long collaborations.

The system should support two different types of users: the supervisors, which
can post new project and thesis ideas; and the students, which can apply for
projects and theses as well as make unsolicited supervision requests. Both students and supervisors should be able to team up around a given project or
thesis. This bare core can be extended in several directions, some of which are
hereafter briefly listed.
• The service could allow users to create private or public threads around
projects and theses with the goal of supporting a buzzing environemnt;
• The descriptions of projects and theses could be augmented either manually – by the creator – or automatically by including keywords describing
the project. This would allow to include powerful searching features;
• The system should allow the inspection of classical statictics (e.g., the
number of visits that a project or theses had in the last week/month).
• The service should allow users to subscribe to specific keywords to receive
notifications once a project or thesis with the given keyword is uploaded
or once students express their interest in specific topics.
• The service should allow users to describe themselves in terms of interests
allowing other types of focused searches.
